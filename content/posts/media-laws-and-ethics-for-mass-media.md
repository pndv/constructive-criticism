Have a thought ever come to your mind that why, at all, the laws are needed? Why should human being remain bound by
those laws? Do you know that in the stone age, there were no laws? Laws came with the evolution and the development of
the civilisation(s) because in the absence of the laws there would be all-around chaos and confusion and the society
will again become barbarian. With the passage of time, evolution took place, and the laws or systems were framed by
consensus or the powerful persons to maintain the semblance of order or the decorum of civilisation. Freedom of speech
and expression is, in fact, the highest form of civilisational dignity. Freedom of speech and expression helps an
individual or community to articulate opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction.

John Stuart Mill famous was a famous political philosopher. He was the greatest champion of ‘civil liberty and free
speech. He argued that free speech is a necessary condition for intellectual and social progress. He was of the view
that any idea which has not been questioned or discussed is like a ‘dead dogma’. In that case, people have little idea
why they accept or why they continue to believe it. Therefore, ‘freedom of speech and expression’ should be cherished
and protected by law.

The democratic government attaches great importance to the freedom of speech and expression because it appeals to
reason, which is the basis or fulcrum of democracy. In India, this right was guaranteed to citizens under Article 19(1)(A) along with the Constitution, which came into force on 26 January 1950. The Supreme Court also came into existence
on the same day when the country became a ‘Republic’. The first case on the issue of freedom of speech and expression
was decided by the Supreme Court in the year 1950 itself even before the Parliamentary elections were held in 1952.

In that case, the petitioner was a well-known journalist Romesh Thapar. He was critical of the foreign policies of the
then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru. In March of 1950, the Government of Madras (Tamilnadu) by virtue of order imposed
a ban on the entry and circulation of his magazine ‘Crossroads’ in some parts of the state for the purpose of ensuring
‘public safety or preserving public order. The Executive order was challenged in the High Court, but it was upheld by
the High Court. Aggrieved by the order of the High Court Mr Thapar approached the Supreme Court contending that it was
in violation of the fundamental right to free speech and expression.

The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Article 19(1)(A) that proved to be the landmark decision. It may be relevant to
mention the First Amendment to the United States of America’s Constitution, which was interpreted to mean that ‘you are
free to say whatever you want, and you are even free to not say anything at all. But that also does not recognise
absolute freedom. Hence, the common limitations, boundaries, or restrictions to freedom of speech relate to ‘libel’,
‘slander’, ‘obscenity’, ‘pornography’, ‘sedition’, ‘incitement’, ‘fighting words, ‘classified information, ‘copyright
violation’, ‘trade secrets, ‘food labelling’, ‘no-disclosure agreements’, ‘right to privacy, ‘right to dignity’, ‘right
to be forgotten, ‘public security’, and ‘perjury’. They all fall within the realm of ‘harm principle, which can be
exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his or her will is to prevent harm to others.

It must be clear at the very outset the guarantee of freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 (1) A] is given
only to the citizens of the country living in India. Foreigners can only enjoy the ‘right to live with dignity under
Article 21 of the Constitution of India while living within the territory of the country. Now let us see the rights
provided under Article 19 (1) (A). It says that All citizens shall have the right:

1. to freedom of speech and expression,
1. to assemble peaceably and without arms,
1. to form associations or unions,
1. to move freely throughout the territory of India,
1. to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; and
1. to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade, or business.

Thus, the the constitution guarantees six fundamental rights to its citizens, which are exercisable by them throughout
and in all parts of the territory of India.

### Reasonable Restrictions under Article 19(2)

The freedom of speech and expression does not give any absolute right to speak or publish, without responsibility,
whatever one may choose. The Constitution does not give unbridled license. This Article enables the legislature to
impose reasonable restrictions on the right to free speech ‘in the interest of’ or ‘in relation to the following.

1. Sovereignty and integrity of India- It may be noted here that the restriction is with respect to the territorial
integrity and not about the preservation of the territorial integrity of the constituent states because Article 3 of the
constitution itself contemplates changes of the territorial limits of the constituent States.
2. Security of the state- The security of the State may well be endangered by crimes of violence intended to overthrow
the government, waging of war and rebellion against the government, external aggression, or war etc. However, every
public disorder cannot be regarded as threatening the security of the state. The Supreme Court has in a catena of cases
held that breaches of public order which do not involve any danger to the state cannot be restricted.
3. Friendly relations with foreign states- This ground of restriction was added to the Constitution by the First
Amendment in 1951, which empowers the State to impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom of speech in the interest
of friendly relations with foreign states. The justification is obvious: unrestrained malicious propaganda against a
foreign-friendly State may jeopardise the maintenance of good relations between India and that State.
4. Public order- The public order is synonymous with public peace, safety, and tranquillity. It signifies the absence
of disorder, national upheavals, civil strife, or war, affecting the security of the state. In the case of Babulal
Parate v State of Maharashtra, the well-known section of the Cr PC was impugned in the Supreme Court on the ground of
its placing unreasonable restrictions on the right of freedom of speech and expression. Under this section, a
Magistrate, if he/she is of the opinion that it is sufficient ground for immediate prevention, can by a written order
direct a person or persons to abstain from certain acts if that is likely to cause disturbance of public tranquillity or
a riot or an affray.
5. Decency or morality- Decency is the same as lack of obscenity. It is obvious that that right to freedom of speech
and expression cannot be permitted to deprave and corrupt the community, and therefore, writings or other objects, if
obscene may be suppressed and punished because such action would be to promote public decency and morality.
6. Incitement to an offence- It hardly needs to be stated that freedom of speech and expression does not confer a
license to incite people to commit an offence. Incitement to murder or other violent crimes would generally endanger the
security of the state, hence a restriction against such incitement would be a valid law. Notably, sedition has not been
mentioned as one of the grounds on which restrictions can be imposed. In fact, these restrictions are like umbrella
restrictions and different forms of it are dealt with on the basis of their interpretations. However, it must be made
clear that reasonable restrictions under these heads can be imposed only by a duly enacted law and not by executive
action. The other two restrictions are the ‘Contempt of Court’ and the ‘Defamation’, about which we will discuss in a
little more detail.

## Contempt of Court

The constitutional right of freedom of speech and expression does not prevent the High Courts and the Supreme Court from
punishing for their contempt either by spoken or printed words or any other expression calculated to have that effect.
The Contempt of Court includes both civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt means wilful disobedience to any
judgment, decree, direction, order under, writ or other processes of a court or a wilful breach of an undertaking is
given to a court. Criminal contempt means the publication, spoken, signs or visible representations of any matter or the
doing of any other act or whatsoever which scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority
of any court.

Criminal contempt of court as defined in section 2 c of the Act, which says that when anything is published, or done,
which scandalizes or tends to scandalize or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court or prejudices or
interferes or tends to interfere with or obstructs or tends to obstruct the administration of justice in any other
manner. The criminal contempt means false statements made to or about judiciary, coercion or attempts to pervert
judicial proceedings by attacking witnesses, parties or judges, recording court proceedings without permission from the
court, obstructing officers of the court from performing the functions as well as verbal abuse against the judges.

Journalists, therefore, have to remain always on guard while reporting or reproducing the court proceedings there are,
however, three defences which are provided to charges of contempt. The first one is that it allows an exemption from
those who innocently publish or commit any act that would otherwise, amount to contempt. The second defence is if the
contemnor reasonably believes that no judicial proceedings were going on regarding these acts and the third one is that
if journalist reasonably believes that his words or actions did not contain anything contemptuous.

### Punishments for Contempt of Court   

Civil and criminal contempt both share the same punishment as provided in the Contempt of Court Act 1971. The Act allows
for a maximum term of punishment of six months and this can be supplemented with a fine of Rupees two thousand. The act
also specifically allows courts to forgo the punishment, if an apology is tendered and the court is satisfied it to be
sufficient.

The constitutional validity of the Contempt of Courts Act 1971 has been found to be valid for holding high the majesty
of justice. However, the powers to punish by the courts for criminal contempt have been criticised by the intelligentsia
of the country that it has got a chilling effect on the freedom of speech and expression.


## Defamation
Defamation means the false publication or communication about a third party attacking the reputation of a person or any
organisation or institution. Defamation tends to bring a person in disrepute. It exposes a person to hatred, ridicule,
or contempt. As a matter of fact, defamation is a creation of English law. Only the injury to the feelings of a person
is not defamation but there has to be a loss of reputation of a person. The defamed person need not be named but must be
ascertainable. Defamation is of two types one is libel and the other is slander.

#### Libel

Libel is defamation in written words, pictures, or any other visual symbols in a print or electronic medium. In recent
times the internet publication which defamed any individual or institution also constitutes libel. There are three
things that constitute libel.

(a) it is made with an intent to harm the prestige; (b) it has been recklessly done showing disregard for the truth,
and (c) it is done with actual malice which can be seen through it.

#### Slander

Slander means harmful statement and it relates mainly to speech. The fundamental difference between libel and slander is
in the form. While the libel relates to writing which offends to the reputation of a person, slander is spoken words or
sounds, sign language and gestures. The common defence is adopted by a person that statements were made in good faith or
with a reasonable belief that they were true.

## Press Council of India 

The Press Council of India is a statutory body that was set up in 1966 but it actually started working in 1978. It is
the self-regulatory watchdog of the press. As its name suggests that it has no jurisdiction over other media like
electronic or internet. Anybody aggrieved with any publication in a newspaper, or a magazine can approach the Press
Council of India for the redressal of the grievances. Similarly, the journalists and newspaper owners can also approach
the Press Council against the high handedness of the government machinery, it has very limited power though it is a
quasi-judicial body, which delivers its judgment after hearing both parties. However, its decisions do not have the
force of the courts. It has got only three types of powers to regulate erring journalist, newspapers or officials. They
are to warn, to admonish or to censure. A warning is given for very mild mistakes but if a mistake is of grave nature
the Press Council can only censure the newspapers or the journalists. It can also investigate the complaints and report
on them. It has no power to enforce them nor impose any penalty on the erring journalists and publications.

### Composition of the Press Council

The Press Council of India consist of 28 members out of the five are the members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Three
members come from the cultural and legal field as the nominee of Sahitya Academy, University Grants Commission and the
Bar Council of India. Seven members come from working journalists, six from the group of editors and six from the owners
of the publications. It is normally headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India.

There has been a strong demand from the various quarters to disband the Press Council of India and replace it with Media
Council with some teeth so as to punish the offenders.

## Press Commission of India

Till now India has seen two Press commissions. The first one was set up within a few months of the constitution of India
in 1952. Its Chairman was Justice GS Rajyadhkash of the Bombay High Court, the other notable members were Dr Zakir
Hussain, Sri R Venkatraman ( Both of them later became the President of India), Dr VKRV Rao ( founder of Delhi School of
Economics, who later became the Union Minister), Sri TN Singh (who later became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh), M
Chalapathi Rao ( who was then the Chief Editor of the National Herald) and the Adivasi leader and Member of Parliament
and former Hockey Olympian, Sri Jaipal Singh Munda. The first Press Commission submitted its report in two years. On its
recommendation, the Working Journalist Act was enacted in 1955. The first Press Commission had also suggested for the
enactment of the Press Council of India which was enacted in 1966 but came into operation in 1968.

The second Press Commission was set up in 1980 under the chairmanship of Justice KK Mathew. Among others, it had two
stalwart journalists like Girilal Jain, the then Chief Editor of the Times of India and the other one was the editor of
the famous Hindi daily Nai Duniya, Sri Rajendra Mathur. While the first Press Commission had studied the state of the
newspapers and recommended for safeguarding the interests of working journalists and also for the regulation of the
publication and published material particularly for strengthening the freedom of speech and expression, the Second Press
Commission remained confined to the economics of the newspapers. It had submitted its report some forty years ago. Since
then, much has changed in the world of media. Social Media has become a very powerful tool in the hands of every person
having a mobile phone in his or her possession. Now people are more dependent the WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram or
Facebook for information than the traditional media. But the information received from these sources lack authenticity
and their verification is an uphill task. Since they are uncontrolled and unverified, they cannot be fully relied upon.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to have a Media Commission to study the scope, direction, economics and objectives of
the media.

## Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

Intellectual Property Rights are the rights given to a person over the creation of their minds. The creator gets an
exclusive right over the use of his/her creation over a certain period of time. This right is necessary to protect the
theft of the intellectual achievements of a person. There are many types of intellectual properties. Some of them are
Copyrights, Patents, Trademark, and Trade Secret etc. Intellectual Property Right gives a guarantee to protect the
labour of the mind and the production and interests of a man or women. The patent is another form of intellectual
property right that is registered in the name of the person or the inventing company.

## Copyright 

The Copyright Act was passed in 1957 and it was last amended in 2012. It has been amended six times since its enactment.
In fact, the Indian Copyright Act is a British India law from 1911, which was first amended in 1914. Copyright is a
bundle of rights given by the law to the creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work and producer of
cinematography and sound recordings. It includes reproduction of work, communication of work to the public, adaptation
of the work and translation from the work, the scope and duration of the protection provided under copyright law. It
varies with the nature of protected law. It is not a Devine or Natural Right. that confers on authors the absolute
ownership of their creations, The Copyright is intended to increase and not to impede the harvest of knowledge. In fact,
its objective is to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors in order to benefit the public.

## Right to Information Act 

It is considered to be a revolutionary that empowers the general public. This Act was passed by the Parliament in 2005
and it sets out rules and procedures regarding citizens' right to information. It has replaced the previous ‘Freedom of
Information Act 2002’.

Under the provisions of the RTI, act any citizen of India may request information from public authority i.e., the body
of government or the instrumentality of the state. This Act is requiring them to reply expeditiously or within 30 days.

In case of the matter involving the petitioner’s life and liberty, the information must be provided within 48 hours.
Thousands of applications are filed under the RTI almost every day seeking information from different departments of
government. Although RTI is not included as a fundamental right, yet it protects the fundamental right of freedom of
speech and expression under Article 19(1)A and the right to life and personal liberty under article 21 of the
Constitution. The authorities under the RTI act is called public authorities. The Public Information Officers (PIOs are
the first appellate authority), who perform the quasi-judicial function of deciding on the applications and appeals.
This Act consolidates the fundamental right of freedom of speech. Private bodies are not covered under this Act. In 2019
this Act was further modified with regard to terms and condition of Information Commissioners working at the Centre and
the State.

## Media Ethics

Every profession is guided by certain ethical values. Any deviation from those values leads to degeneration in the
profession. Media ethics talks about the principles and standards to be adopted by the media. Which includes print,
film, electronic, theatre, art and internet etc. Media promotes and defends values like universal respect for life and
the rule of law and legality. It defines and deals with ethical questions on how media should use text and pictures
provided by the citizens.

The profession of Media, like teaching, medicine, law and other services, have to take extreme caution in maintaining
the highest moral principles; so that they do not cause any harm to society. The media ought to be the searchlights that
help citizens to discover their own faults and foibles, and understand decisions taken (or not taken) by the government
for the welfare of society. It must highlight the good deeds done by people—citizens and of those who are in authority,
for the betterment of social, economic, political, and cultural life.

### Brief History of Media Ethics

This is comparatively a new term that came into use in the latter half of the 20th century. In relation to news
coverage, media ethics means impartiality, objectivity, and balance. It is expected to be unbiased, maintain privacy and
the public interest. It must maintain decency, avoid obscenity, and champion the cause of the freedom of speech and
expression. It must be cautious about good advertising practices and keep itself away from the legal issues of
defamation etc. It has to be accountable to the social cause and must follow the regulatory rules. Journalists must be
careful about the news manipulation by vested interests. The owners and the corporations many times adopt the very
subtle way of manipulation. Those who do not remain cautious often become part of news propaganda.

The truth must be adhered to in all cases. Although it is often found to be in conflict with many values, it must not go
against the public interest even if it is true because media is an indispensable pillar of democracy. It purveys public
opinion and also shapes it. Parliamentary democracy can flourish under the watchful eyes of the media. Hence, the media
not only reports but acts as a bridge between the state and the public. However, the media cannot lose sight of its
privileges, duties and obligations. Needless to mention that journalism is a profession that serves, and ethics is the
code of values, which govern our lives and are thus very essential for a moral and healthy life. The first step in the
evolution of ethics is the sense of solidarity with other human beings. Media must follow the principle of enjoying the
public trust, observe fairness, integrity, and maintain independence and own accountability.

## Fundamental Duties

While the Constitution of India provides certain fundamental rights, it also imposes certain duties on the citizens,
which are called fundamental duties. These fundamental duties of citizens were added to the constitution by the 42nd
Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee. Originally there were ten fundamental duties,
which was increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002. It added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that
their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other
fundamental duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the constitution, to
cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defence. They also obligate all Indians to
promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure
violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life.

The fundamental duties obligate upon every citizen of India:

1. To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag, and the National Anthem.
2. To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom.
3. To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.
4. To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so.
5. To promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious,
   linguistic, and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women.
6. To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture.
7. To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, wildlife and to have compassion for
   living creatures.
8. To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.
9. To safeguard public property and to abjure violence.
10. To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly
    rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement.
11. To cast responsibility on parents and guardians to provide opportunities for education to his child, or the ward
    between the age of six to fourteen years.

## Code of Conduct in journalism

It is an accepted truth that any information received in the form of news either through newspapers or audio-visual
media has more credibility than the advertisements, which are obviously paid for getting popularity. However, these days
a new trend of ‘fake news’ has arisen, which has hugely corroded the sanctity of the news and views.

Therefore, a journalist must keep one’s conduct beyond all reproach. In recent times, the media world has been hit with
several scandals related to the way in which they have tried to manipulate the system for their benefit. If in the UK,
the Rupert Murdoch owned NewsCorp was caught bribing the police to access personal details of people and to hack their
phones, in India, there have been several scandals related to the blackmailing of industrial houses. Further, the fact
that “paid news” or “infomercials” or “advertorials” (commercials passed off information or editorials) have dented the
reputation of the media houses. Hence, there is a need for a robust code of conduct for journalists to stop the
degenerative trend. It must be an alert watchdog in a democracy to keep others on their toes.

### How Does the Code of Conduct Work?

The most important reason why the media needs a code of conduct for itself is that along with the Legislature,
Executive, and the Judiciary, it is the purveyor of public good and hence, must be above suspicion. The code of conduct
can be along the lines of having the journalists declare that the article or the news that they have published or shown
has not been paid the by industrial houses and the information in the article or visual has been obtained ethically. In
other words, the journalists should be scrutinized for unethical practices and made to observe the code of conduct
diligently. There is a need to protect sources since that is the bottom-line of journalism, the journalists must ensure
that it has not been obtained by unethical means. The function of the media is not to “massage the message” and “spin
the facts” but to report them as they are.

### Voluntary Compliance with the Code

The other aspect of the code of conduct is that it must be made binding on the journalists and any attempt to circumvent
it should be made punishable. This calls for having an ‘ombudsman’ for the media to oversee the various publications and
ensure that the media is sticking to the code of conduct. In fact, precisely for these reasons, the Press Council of
India was set up but that is now proving to be inadequate mainly due to increasing impropriety, absence of regulatory
powers and unprecedented explosion of media. Apart from this, each media house must have internal vigilance wherein the
voluntary practice of adhering to the code of conduct must be practised.

As any industry veteran would attest that voluntary compliance is the best way and some media houses in India have done
but that needs to be institutionalised and strengthened. Prevention is better than cure and hence, the media houses and
their unethical practices must be nipped in the bud and not allowed to outgrow the institution.

## Practical Aspects of Self-Regulation

Media, the fourth pillar and the backbone of democracy have never hogged more limelight in India in the last few years.
In the scramble for TRPs (Target Rating Points), the line between news and entertainment has got blurred. While the
legislatures make laws, the judiciary interprets and the executive implements them, it is the media that acts as the
watchdog of the three pillars to ensure that they are performing their constitutional duties, thus calling for
accountability. Considering the fact that the media performs such an important function, it is particularly important
that there should be some codes or ethics for it, lest the media take undue advantage of its role. India's vibrant media
landscape includes close to 650 television channels, more than 2,000 publications, over 80,000 newspapers and more than
30 FM radio operators running 245 stations. And not to forget our very powerful new social media

While Print media in India is regulated by the Press Council of India, Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 applies
to Broadcast Media. Although there is no regulatory authority set up under the Act, yet it has the Program Code and
Advertising code, which prohibit the broadcast of any program or advertisement, which are not inconsistent with the Act.

### Self-Regulation and its Advantages

Formal and compulsory directions regarding content, structure and conduct of media form part of media regulation. As we
all know that freedom of speech and expression is not only important in itself but it also protects other freedoms and
rights. Freedom of expression requires a public dimension, and the need was felt to include the same at the
international level. The importance of their freedom is reflected by its extensive protection in International
Convention and Treaties. Self-regulation is not censorship or self-censorship, but it sets up the minimum standard of
accuracy, ethics etc.

Arguments that go in favour of the self-regulation of media is that since it plays a vital role in aiding democracy, so
it is important to preserve the independence and autonomy of media by self-regulation. Moreover, in this global
environment where jurisdictional issues are complex, self-regulation is a better way to handle the situation. The
concept of self-regulation is less costly, and it can also raise professional standards as an organization needs to
analyse and develop its own codes of conduct. If judges, advocates, chartered accountants, and doctors could be held
liable then why not media?

### De-merits of Self-Regulation

The rapid increase in unethical and illegal practices by media indicate the idea of self-regulation will not help in
long run. Supreme Court observed that there should be a law controlling electronic media. In the Secretary Ministry of
I&B v Cricket Association of Bengal, it was held that ‘media misreporting, defamation, cross-media ownership, paid news,
sale of air- time and advertisements, sensationalizing in reporting, health scares and terror attacks, invading the
privacy of individuals and trial by media cases/incidents are increasing day by day, which underlines that
self-regulation is not effective to meet the ethical standards of the media industry.
