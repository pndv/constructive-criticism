Recently, a TV journalist asked former CJI Ranjan Gogoi why did he not go to court when a lady employee of the court
levelled allegations against him, which he thought to be false?? Without batting an eyelid, he replied that who would go
to the court to face further harassment? In a way, he echoed the sentiments of millions of people of the country about
the Indian judicial system. At a time when algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have brought about inconceivable
changes in the field of science, technology, medicine, art, architecture, transportation, communication, war and
weaponry or other areas that we can think of, how long law and legal field will remain untouched of it? Genome
technology is out to achieve what was being mentioned in myths that children of extraordinary physical and mental
strength can be produced with the help of technology guided by AI, then why no efforts are being made to increase the
application of Artificial Intelligence in the justice delivery system?

Two scientific experiments in China have woken up the whole world out of slumber. One is the development of fusion of an
artificial sun, which is said to be five times hotter than the real sun and the other is digitisation to streamline case
handling and use of cyberspace for cloud computing of the court cases. One may have reservations about the Judicial
Systems of China but how can one ignore the breakthrough that she has been able to develop an easy, cheap, and
expeditious justice delivery system? 

Our system is horribly complex, expensive, and time-consuming. It is true that the
justice delivery system of China and Islamic countries is a hoax, and it cannot be followed in democratic countries like
ours, but should the efforts of innovations with the help of ArtificialIntelligence not be undertaken in India when
millions of cases are lying piled in the dark rooms of courts? The Judicial system in India has become a nightmare for
the people of the country, which has given rise to corruption in the system.

AI has also removed the age-long complaints of ‘justice delayed is justice denied.' In this system, one can register the
complaints online and log on for their court hearing. In this manner a total of 118, 764 cases were filed in the Supreme
People’s Court and out of it 88, 401 were concluded in one year. Chinese have adopted the Blockchain method, which is
being taught in our IITs and Computer Science Departments of other Engineering Colleges. In this method ‘information is
recorded in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, cheat or tamper with’. 

Internet has, no doubt, changed the very methodology of research, storage of information and speed of transmission. The
time has come that the maximum use of AIs should be made in the justice delivery system of the country. It will make the
language of the courts simple and comprehensible, which is obtuse and complex in our courts. The initiative in this
regard has to be taken more by the scientists and the government of the day than by the judges and advocates, who are
trained to walk more on the beaten path than opting for any innovation. Unfortunately, our judicial system creates
firewalls for any type of newness rather than embracing it with an open mind and arms. Increased usage of Artificial
Intelligence will certainly render most of the advocates jobless and the number of judges can be reduced to less than 10
per cent to what it is today. But that cannot be taken as a plea for revolutionizing the justice delivery system.
