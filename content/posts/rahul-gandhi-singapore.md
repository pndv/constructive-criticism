# What Rahul Gandhi should have said in response to the professor’s question in Singapore…
I saw [this exchange on YouTube](https://youtu.be/VFM6m41LUMM?t=6) and cringed at Mr. Gandhi’s reply. The professor, besides using the platform to shamelessly promote his book also accused Mr. Gandhi’s family for the abysmal performance of Indian economy after independence. Here is how I would have replied to his comments:

Dear professor,

You have alleged that while my family has been in power, the growth rate of India remained sub-optimal. As a professor of economics, are you sure that you have not fell into the trap of assuming correlation as causality? A trap, against which every economics professor warns their students.

Do you think it was because of Nehru that India was in abject poverty at the time of independence? Or do you think that India could have started growing at 10% per annum right from the stroke of midnight hour of 15th August 1947?

Does the fact that more than half of country was illiterate, that we were recovering from a bloody partition and still consolidating the territories of India mean nothing to you? While I cannot claim my family, or even myself to be flawless individuals, I can assure you that we certainly made tthe decisions which were thought to be best for India during that time.
